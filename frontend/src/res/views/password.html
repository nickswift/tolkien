            Enter a username/password combo. First login creates the user, 
            and subsequent attempts to log in are subjected to cross-referencing
            of the input password.

                <p>
                    When you input login data, this application collects 
                    information about the way in which the password is entered. 
                    This includes time between keystrokes and number of 
                    backspaces used. The application also keeps track of 
                    unsuccessful login attempts. This information is sent to the 
                    server alongside the traditional login information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the backend, the password is hashed using bcrypt, and if 
                    it is found to be correct, the password metadata is compared 
                    with the user's metadata fingerprint, ie. the mean of all 
                    previous login attempts wherin each point is analyzed for 
                    standard deviation from the computed mean. If this fails, 
                    then the login attempt fails, and the current metadata is 
                    thrown out. Otherwise the login attempt succeeds, and the 
                    metadata is recorded for use future attempts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reason for doing this is that it can potentially prevent 
                    someone from simply stealing your password and inputting it, 
                    since doing so in this system would require the attacker to 
                    know not only the password, but also the way in which the 
                    password is typed by a legitimate user. This system is also 
                    invisible to the user, since it takes several points of data 
                    to become active, and since the system is sensitive to 
                    subtle changes in the user's login pattern over time -- 
                    incorporating successful login attempts into the metadata 
                    fingerprint.
